     <p>My hobby is playing shogi, shogi is a Japanese chess. This is a chess made up of 40 chessman. 
     The main reason I like shogi is because except for the king, other chessman can be promoted and captured.
     When promoted, you only need to turn the chessman over, no need to prepare extra chessman.
     When the chessman are promoted, new moves will be obtained. 
     When the promoted chessman is captured, it will change back to the original chessman, allowing the owner of the chessman to decide when to join the battlefield. 
     There is another piece that cannot be promoted but can be captured, it is the gold general. 
     The chessman of both sides are not distinguish by color like Chinese chess and Western chess, the front of each chessman of shogi is pointed, and the pointed part is pointed in the direction of the enemy to indicate that it is its own chessman.</p>
     <p>The chessman of shogi are:</p>
     <ul style="list-style: square;">
        <li>Jade General and Great General(King) X 2</li>
        <li>Gold General X 4</li>
        <li>Silver General X 4</li>
        <li>Laurel Horse X 4</li>
        <li>Fragrant Chariot X 4</li>
        <li>Angle Goer X 2</li>
        <li>Flying Chariot X 2</li>
        <li>Foot Soldier X 18</li>
     </ul>
